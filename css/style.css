Step 6: Identify the proper selector to style ONLY those header elements that are direct children of a card class.  The required styling is the following: 
Step 6a: background: #288088,
Step 6b: solid 2px border using #45ADAD,
Step 6c: 20px of padding on the top and the bottom, 
Step 6d: 50px border-radius on the top left and right corners. 


Check your work. The corners probably aren’t curving quite as you expected. Use Inspect Element to fix this problem. You will need to utilize a second selector.

Steps 7 and 8 go together.  You won’t have the right “look” until you finish both.

Step 7: Edit the css for the card class to match our example. Achieve this by using a flex-property to specify an initial “size” of 450px.

Questions:
1. Step 5 (nav_links): Do I need to use inherit?
    1(a). Does "style the links" mean nav links or all links including skip to main content?

2. Mobile View (.gallery): Is it ok that it looks like that in mobile view but when I stretch it
to 720 px it looks like the screenshot?
3. Step 13: Is it ok to do it this way and use body as a parent selector? Are you grading us on our code?
4. Step 20 (print view, gallery): It looks like the video and not the screenshot is that okay? The footer is not on the next page
